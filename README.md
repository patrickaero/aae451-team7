This code was written by some college seniors years ago and has been archived here for my own posterity.

## Scripts/Code Included:
- Initial Sizing contains tools used for initial sizing of tiltrotor.
- STOL Initial Sizing contains tools used for initial sizing of STOL aircraft.
- Detailed sizing contains sizing code updated with drag prediction and final aircraft configuration.
- Performance contains performance calculation tools.
- ElectricJustification.m produces energy density requirements for given L/D and range requirements.
- EmptyWeightSizing.m was used to generate tiltoror empty weight estimating relationship.
- PreLim_Tiltrotor_ConstraintDiagram.m was used to generate the tiltoror constraint diagrams at various performance regimes.
